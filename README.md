I am currently pursuing Master's of Engineering in Robotics at University of Maryland, College park . I am always hinged upon the concept of 'Digitalization' and I aim at implementing the process automation at the ground level, by using cutting edge technologies like AI / ML. I strive to explore opportunities in Robotics Process Automation (RPA) and Industry 4.0. Being a synergic and an industrious individual, I tend to develop a healthy workplace ecosystem and uplift the overall productivity of my team. Always embracing versatility,I spend my spare time cultivating new hobbies.
